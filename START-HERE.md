# Start here

This repo holds your project's website. You'll mostly write in four pages:

| Page | What goes in it |
|---|---|
| **What it is** | A photo and a few sentences. |
| **Log** | Where you started, entries as you go, and where it landed. |
| **Anatomy** | A diagram, your parts list, and any design files. |
| **Build it** | Optional instructions. Stays hidden until you write in it. |

Each page has hidden prompts (questions) to get you going. They don't show on
the website, so you never need to delete them.

**Done looks like:** a photo and a few sentences, a log with a start and an end,
and a diagram with a parts list. Everything else is a bonus.

## One-time setup (about 10 minutes)

1. **Turn on the website.** Settings → Pages → Source: **GitHub Actions**.
2. **Fill in your details.** In `mkdocs.yml` and `README.md`, replace
   `PROJECT NAME`, `YOUR NAME`, `ORG-NAME` and `REPO-NAME`.
3. **Tag the repo.** On the main page, click the gear next to **About** and add
   the topics `mars-college`, `dept-of-makers`, `mars-2027`. Paste in your
   website link.
4. **Open it in Pages CMS** at https://app.pagescms.org and sign in with GitHub.
   From here on, you can do everything there.

Your site appears at `https://ORG-NAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/` and updates a minute
or two after every save.

## Good to know

- **Photos:** upload under Media → Photos, then add `![what it shows](images/name.jpg)`
  to a page. Phone photos are fine; keep each under about 5 MB, or shrink them first
  with `tools/resize_photos.py`.
- **Parts list:** opens as a spreadsheet. Only *item* and *qty* matter; fill in
  the rest if you know it. The *section* column groups parts to match your diagram.
  In *cost_each* you can type a number or a word like `salvaged` or `free`.
- **Files:** anything you upload under Media → Files is listed on your Anatomy
  page automatically.
- **Video:** put it on YouTube or Vimeo and paste the link.
- **A PDF of everything:** create a release on GitHub (Releases → Draft a new
  release, tag `v1.0`). A PDF is attached a few minutes later.

You can delete this file once you're set up.
